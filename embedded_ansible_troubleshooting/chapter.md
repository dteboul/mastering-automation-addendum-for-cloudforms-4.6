# Troubleshooting Embedded Ansible

This chapter contains some miscellaneous troubleshooting tips for the embedded Ansible automation engine, and for the running playbooks themselves.

## Troubleshooting the Embedded Ansible Engine (AWX)

When troubleshooting why playbooks are not running as intended, it can sometimes be useful to confirm that the embedded Ansible automation engine - which is based on the AWX project - is running correctly. Although the **Embedded Ansible** server role can be started on several appliances in a region, it will only be active on one appliance. 

The troubleshooting steps should be carried out on the appliance with the active **Embedded Ansible** role. The server with the currently active role can be determined from the **Configuration -> Diagnostics** (accordion) **Region -> Servers by Roles** tab (see screenshot [Servers by Roles in Region](#i1)).

### AWX Processes 

The AWX processes are managed by supervisord, and can be checked using `supervisorctl` as follows:

```
# supervisorctl
exit-event-listener                     RUNNING   pid 17390, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-callback-receiver   RUNNING   pid 17394, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-celeryd             RUNNING   pid 17396, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-celeryd-beat        RUNNING   pid 17395, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-channels-worker     RUNNING   pid 17391, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-daphne              RUNNING   pid 17393, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
tower-processes:awx-uwsgi               RUNNING   pid 17392, uptime 20 days, 3:15:47
supervisor>
```

The supervisord configuration is located in _/etc/supervisord.d/tower.ini_.

### AWX Services

There are three systemd services associated with AWX, as follows:

```
systemctl status supervisord
systemctl status nginx
systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```

The status of these three services can be seen using the command:

```
ansible-tower-service status
```

### Rails Console Checks

The health of AWX can be checked from Rails. The `EmbeddedAnsible.new.running?` method checks that the supervisord, nginx and rabbitmq-server services are running correctly.

```
irb(main):001:0> EmbeddedAnsible.new.running?
=> true
```

The Rails `EmbeddedAnsible.new.alive?` method pings the Ansible server using the auto-configured credentials. This verifies that the credentials are setup correctly.

```
irb(main):002:0> EmbeddedAnsible.new.alive?
=> true
```

### AWX Logs

The AWX services write to 2 log files:

```
/var/log/supervisor/
/var/log/tower/
```

There is also some AWX-related logging in _/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log_.

### AWX Authentication Settings

The AWX `admin` account password is randomly generated during installation (when the **Embedded Ansible** server role is first enabled), and these credentials are used by CloudForms / ManageIQ to access the internal AWX API. If required for troubleshooting purposes the password string can be retrieved using the Rails console, for example:

```
irb(main):003:0> MiqDatabase.first.ansible_admin_authentication.password
=> "TxaUkrPwmLWNMCDyyimVSL8b"
```

### Virtual Environment

AWX maintains all playbooks and python libraries in a virtual environment under _/var/lib/awx/venv_. To install or update anything in the virtual environment the `activate/deactivate` commands should be used, for example:

```
source /var/lib/awx/venv/ansible/bin/activate
umask 0022
pip install --upgrade pywinrm
deactivate
```

## Troubleshooting Embedded Ansible Jobs

Each invocation of an embedded Ansible playbook service or method is implemented by the running of an embedded Ansible (AWX) job.

### Job Log Files

Each time an embedded Ansible job runs, up to three _.out_ files are created in _/var/lib/awx/job\_status_ on the CFME or ManageIQ appliance with the active **Embedded Ansible** role. The first two of these files show the results of synchronising the git repository and updating any roles, and the last file contains the output from the automation playbook itself.

[root@cloudforms job_status]#
```

The directory can be monitored for new files using the command `watch "ls -lrt | tail -10"`

#### Log Output to _evm.log_

The option of whether to log playbook output to _evm.log_ can be made when the playbook service or method is created or edited (see screenshot [Setting Logging Output](#i2)).

![Setting Logging Output](images/screenshot1.png)

#### Logging Verbosity

The desired log verbosity can be selected when the playbook service or method is created or edited (see screenshot [Setting Logging Verbosity](#i3)).

![Setting Logging Verbosity](images/screenshot2.png)

This log verbosity affects the output to the job _*.out_ file as well as any log output to _evm.log_.

### Max TTL Too Low

If the **Max TTL (mins)** value for a playbook method is too low the _ManageIQ::Providers::EmbeddedAnsible::AutomationManager::PlaybookRunner_ class will terminate the playbook job with an error such as:

```
Automation Error: job timed out after 96.890827024 seconds of inactivity. Inactivity threshold [60 seconds]
```

The  **Max TTL (mins)** value should be set to the maximum expected run-time in the Ansible playbook method definition.

### Workspace Initialization Errors

The `manageiq-automate` and `manageiq-vmdb` modules can fail to connect (or authenticate) back to a valid API endpoint if the `manageiq.api_url` playbook variable contains the IP address of a different appliance to the one that launched the playbook. In this situation an error similar to the following is seen in the playbook output:

```
TASK [syncrou.manageiq-automate : Initialize the Workspace] ********************
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "module_stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/ansible_xVSkWs/ansible_module_manageiq_automate.py\", line 510, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/tmp/ansible_xVSkWs/ansible_module_manageiq_automate.py\", line 502, in main\n    result = getattr(workspace, key)(value)\n  File \"/tmp/ansible_xVSkWs/ansible_module_manageiq_automate.py\", line 408, in initialize_workspace\n    workspace = self.get()\n  File \"/tmp/ansible_xVSkWs/ansible_module_manageiq_automate.py\", line 92, in get\n    return json.loads(result.read())\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'\n", "module_stdout": "", "msg": "MODULE FAILURE", "rc": 0}
```

In a multi-appliance region the value of `manageiq.api_url` could be randomly set to any appliance with the **Web Services** server role enabled. The value of the `manageiq.api_token` variable is used to authenticate the connection request back to the API, but this could fail unless the **Configuration -> Advanced** `session_store` setting is set to "sql" on _every_ appliance with the **Web Services** role enabled.

> **Note**
> 
> The evmserverd service must be restarted after changing the **Configuration -> Advanced** `session_store` setting.

The `manageiq-automate` and `manageiq-vmdb` modules can also fail with the same error if the server at the `manageiq.api_url` is experiencing problems with its `evmserverd` service, or if the server or its service has been stopped less than 10 minutes prior to the connection attempt.

## Summary

This chapter has described some of the troubleshooting steps that can be taken to diagnose problems when running Ansible playbook methods or services.
